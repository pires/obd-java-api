 * As per https://www.elmelectronics.com/help/obd/tips/#327_Commands:
 * <p>
 * If a connection is lost, you will need to tell the ELM327 to ‘close’ the
 * current connection, with a Protocol Close command (AT PC). This will ensure
 * that the ELM327 starts from the beginning when the next request is made. This
 * is particularly important for the ISO 9141 and ISO 14230 protocols, as they
 * need to send a special initiation sequence.
 * <p>
 * Once the protocol has been closed, it can be re-opened by making a request
 * such as 01 00 (do not send ATZ or AT SP0, as many do).
